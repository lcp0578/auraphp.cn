# Introduction to Aura

The primary goal of Aura is to provide high-quality, well-tested,
standards-compliant, decoupled libraries that can be used in any codebase.
This means you can use as much or as little of the project as you like.

## Packages

The Aura project centers around a collection of independent packages.
Each package is self-contained and has only the things it needs for its
core purpose. None of the packages depends on any of the other; you can
[download](http://auraphp.com/packages) and use each of the packages on its own.

## The Aura System

The Aura System provides a full-stack Aura framework built around [Aura library
packages](http://auraphp.com/packages). If you are looking for standalone
versions of a package look into the package documentation.
