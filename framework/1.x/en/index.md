Welcome to Aura Framework
=========================

Aura framework is built on the top of [aura libraries](/packages/).
If you are looking for documentation on individual libraries,
check out the [packages documentation](/packages/).

The Aura Framework manual is still a work in progress (WIP).
If you are interested in contributing to the manual please fork
[https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com](https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com)
and contribute.

Structure of Manual
-------------------

The framework manual is under
[manuals folder](https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com/tree/master/framework)

The folder structure inside the manuals is

{% highlight bash %}
manuals
    └── v1
        ├── en
        │   └── markdown-files
        └── ja
{% endhighlight %}

If you are interested to contribute on a different language,
first [look into the issues](https://github.com/auraphp/auraphp.github.com/issues?labels=manuals&page=1&state=open).

So if someone is already working on it, we can collaborate and
not duplicate the work already done.

If you didnot find the language, create an issue so others know you
have started the work on that particular language.

Fork and add the
[2 letter language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
and the translated contents.

If you have any questions feel free to ask at
[auraphp groups](http://groups.google.com/group/auraphp).

Hosting and Rendering
---------------------

The manuals are rendered with the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
and hosted in [github](https://github.com).

You can install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) in your local system and
see how it renders.
