The Aura "system" package, which combines a system skeleton and the Aura libraries into a full-stack framework, was released today at 1.0.0 stable. This makes it formally ready for production use (although it has been in production use informally for the past year or so).

You can now start an Aura project with a single [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) command:

    composer create-project aura/system /path/to/your/project

Take a look at the [installation instructions](http://auraphp.com/framework) for more information.

It feels great to have both [stable, decoupled, truly independent package libraries](http://auraphp.com/packages) **and** a system that integrates them into a framework. Many, many thanks to everyone involved who helped get us to this point.
