Late last night we released version 1.0.0-beta4 of the full-stack [system][],
which composes all the independent Aura packages into a coherent framework
using the [Aura.Framework][] package in a project skeleton. We have extracted
the "hello world" portions into their own [Aura.Demo][] package so that it can
be removed or disabled when you begin your project. [Download][] it and take
it for a spin!
