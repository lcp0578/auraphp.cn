I suppose it makes sense that since the the main author behind the [PSR-4 Autoloader  recommendation](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) is also the lead on the Aura project, that Aura would have the first PSR-4 implementation.  You can download it here ...

and you can find the README here (or in the download, of course):

- [https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Autoload/tree/2.x](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Autoload/tree/2.x)

I expect Composer will have support for PSR-4 soon as well.

**UPDATE:** Well that didn't take long: [PSR-4 autoloading support in Composer](http://seld.be/notes/psr-4-autoloading-support-in-composer)
