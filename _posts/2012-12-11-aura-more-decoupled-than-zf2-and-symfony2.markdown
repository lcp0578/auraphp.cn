PHP Magazin published a followup interview with Paul M. Jones about Aura,
regarding decoupled components in Zend Framework 2 and Symfony 2.

> Being able to use Symfony2 components or ZF2 modules is not quite the
> distinction I am making. The distinction is that all Aura packages (with
> the exception of the Framework package) are completely independent, and
> have no cross-package dependencies, whereas at least some of the
> components from Symfony2 and ZF2 have dependency requirements.
> 
> By way of comparison, let’s examine something that ought to be relatively
> straightforward: input validation and filtering. We’ll start with ZF2,
> then move on to Symfony2, and end with Aura. In each case, we will try to
> download the package and run its tests; this should be a good indicator of
> whether or not the package can be used independently. We will discover
> that you can’t do it at all with ZF2, you can kind of do it with Symfony2,
> and that it’s trivially easy with Aura.
