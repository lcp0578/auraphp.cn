Over the past 10 days or so, we've been working on getting out new releases of the v2 and v1 packages. Here's the story.

First, we have brand new 2.0.0 stable releases of these v2 packages!

- [Aura.Dispatcher](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Dispatcher/releases)
- [Aura.Router](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router/releases)
- [Aura.Cli](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli/releases)
- [Aura.View](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/releases)
- [Aura.Html](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Html/releases)

Next, the Aura.Di package just got bumped to 2.0.0-beta2. This package in particular has seen some great new improvements, most notably auto-resolution of typehinted constructor parameters, and a brand-new README. Check it out at <https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di>.

We have our first release of Aura.Session v2 as 2.0.0-beta1. You can see it at <https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Session>.

Also, we have updated stable releases of these packages with some feature additions:

- [Aura.Sql 2.1.0](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Sql/releases)
- [Aura.SqlQuery 2.1.0](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.SqlQuery/releases)

Finally, some of the v1 packages needed to have v2 config classes either added or fixed. As a result, we now have these new v1 package releases:

- Aura.Filter 1.0.2
- Aura.Input 1.1.2
- Aura.Intl 1.1.1
- Aura.Marshal 1.2.2
- Aura.Signal 1.0.4

That's all for now!
