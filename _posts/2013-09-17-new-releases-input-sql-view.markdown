On the heels of last week's slew of releases, we have three followups!

The [Aura.Input][] package got a feature-level bump to 1.1.0, with a new FormFactory. Thanks to Hari KT for championing that one.

[Aura.Sql][] is now at 1.3.0, due to lots of work from MAXakaWIZARD to provide SQLite- and PostgreSQL-specific query objects.

Finally, the [Aura.View][] package got a bugfix and is now at 1.2.1; it handles content-type negotiation better for those times when there is no `Accept` header.

Take a look at [all of the Aura packages here][packages] -- each of them completely decoupled from the others, ready for you to use with no additional dependencies.

Thanks to everyone who helped on these releases!
