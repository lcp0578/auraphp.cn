The [Aura Project for PHP 5.4](http://auraphp.github.com) is happy to announce
its first release of 1.0.0 stable library packages. The packages include:

- [Aura.Autoload](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Autoload)
- [Aura.Cli](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli)
- [Aura.Di](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di)
- [Aura.Http](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Http)
- [Aura.Marshal](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Marshal)
- [Aura.Router](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router)
- [Aura.Signal](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Signal)
- [Aura.Sql](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Sql)
- [Aura.Uri](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Uri)
- [Aura.View](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View)
- [Aura.Web](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web)

In addition, we have initial beta releases of three new library packages:

- [Aura.Filter](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Filter)
- [Aura.Intl](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Intl)
- [Aura.Session](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Session)

Each library package is independent of all the others, so you can pick and
choose which ones you want to use. With few exceptions, each class in each
package has 100% PHPUnit test coverage. Each package has a full README for
getting started. They all have a `composer.json` file and are registered at
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/search/?q=aura).

While the above packages are completely independent of each other, Aura also
has a [Framework](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework) package that
binds them all together. Releasing the next version of that Framework and
system skeleton is the next thing for us to do.
